        Beef Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish that is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other parts of
        the world. It is made by cooking basmati rice with tender pieces of beef, along with a variety of spices, herbs,
        and sometimes vegetables.

        The process of making Beef Biryani involves several steps. First, the beef is marinated in a mixture of yogurt
        and spices, which helps to tenderize the meat and infuse it with flavor. The marinated beef is then cooked until
        it is browned and partially cooked.

        Meanwhile, the rice is partially cooked separately and then layered with the partially cooked beef in a large
        pot or oven-proof dish. The layers of rice and beef are alternated, and sometimes vegetables like onions,
        tomatoes, and potatoes are added in between the layers.

        To enhance the flavors, various spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala are added to the
        dish. Saffron or food colorings are often used to give the rice a vibrant yellow or orange color. The pot is
        then covered tightly and cooked on low heat or baked in the oven until the rice is fully cooked and the flavors
        have melded together.

        Beef Biryani is typically garnished with fried onions, chopped cilantro, and mint leaves before serving. It is
        often enjoyed with raita (a yogurt-based condiment) or a side salad. This dish is known for its rich and
        aromatic flavors, making it a favorite for special occasions, celebrations, and feasts.
